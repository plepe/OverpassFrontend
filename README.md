# OverpassFrontend
A JavaScript (NodeJS/Browser) library to easily access data from OpenStreetMap via Overpass API. The objects can directly be used with LeafletJS or exported to GeoJSON. Data will be cached locally, optionally by using LocalStorage (or similar).

# API
## OverpassFrontend(url, options)
The constructor for accessing the Overpass API.

```js
var overpassFrontend = new OverpassFrontend('//overpass-api.de/api/', {
});
```

Parameters:

| Name    | Type   | Description
| ------- | ------ | ---------------------
| url     | string | The URL of the API, e.g. 'https://overpass-api.de/api/'. If you omit the protocol, it will use the protocol which is in use for the current page (or https: on nodejs): '//overpass-api.de/api/'.
| options | object | various options, see below

Options:

| Option  | Type   | Description
| ------- | ------ | ------------
| effortPerRequest | number | To avoid huge requests to the Overpass API, the request will be split into smaller chunks. This value defines, at which effort the request will be sent. Default: 1000.
| effortNode | number | The effort for request a node. Default: 1.
| effortWay | number | The effort for request a way. Default: 4.
| effortRelation | number | The effort for request a relation. Default: 64.
| timeGap | number (ms) | A short time gap between two requests to the Overpass API. Default: 10 milliseconds.

## OverpassFrontend.get(ids, options, featureCallback, finalCallback)
Get a list of OpenStreetMap objects from Overpass API.

Parameters:

| Name    | Type   | Description
| ------- | ------ | -------------
| ids     | string, string[] | One or more IDs, e.g. [ 'n123', 'w2345', 'n123' ]. Illegal IDs will not produce an error but generate a 'null' object.
| options | object | Various options, see below
| featureCallback | function | Will be called for each object in the order of the IDs in parameter 'ids'. Will be passed: 1. err (if an error occured, otherwise null), 2. the object or null, 3. the index in the array ids.
| finalCallback | function | Will be called after the last feature. Will be passed: 1. err (if an error occured, otherwise null).

Options:

| Option  | Type   | Description
| ------- | ------ | ------------
| priority | number | Priority for loading these objects. The lower the sooner they will be requested. Default: 0
| sort | string | Call the featureCallback in some particular order. See below for possible sort orders. `null` (default): no particular order.
| sortDir | "asc" or "desc" | Sort direction. Default: "asc"
| bbox    | L.latLngBounds | Only include objects which intersect the given bbox. The featureCallback will be called anyway, but boolean false will be passed.
| properties | bit array | Which properties of the features should be downloaded: OVERPASS_ID_ONLY, OVERPASS_BBOX, OVERPASS_TAGS, OVERPASS_GEOM, OVERPASS_META. Combine by binary OR: ``OVERPASS_ID | OVERPASS_BBOX``. Default: ``OVERPASS_BBOX | OVERPASS_TAGS | OVERPASS_MEMBERS``

Available sort orders:

If no sort order (resp. `null`) is specified, the featureCallback can be called as soon as the object is loaded (e.g. immediately, if it is already loaded).

| Sort Type | Description  |
| --------- | ------------ |
| index     | Features should be returned in the order of the 'ids' array. |
| BBoxDiagonalLength | Order by the length of the diagonal of the bounding box. |

Returns an OverpassRequest object.

## OverpassFrontend.BBoxQuery(query, bbox, options, featureCallback, finalCallback)
Run the specified query in the specified bounding box.

Parameters:

| Name    | Type   | Description
| ------- | ------ | -------------
| query   | string | Query for requesting objects from Overpass API, e.g. "node[amenity=restaurant]"
| bbox    | L.latLngBounds | A Leaflet Bounds object, e.g. from map.getBounds()
| options | object | Various options, see below
| featureCallback | function | Will be called for each object in the order of the IDs in parameter 'ids'. Will be called for each object in the order of the IDs in parameter 'ids'. Will be passed: 1. err (if an error occured, otherwise null), 2. the object or null.
| finalCallback | function | Will be called after the last feature. Will be passed: 1. err (if an error occured, otherwise null).

Options:

| Option  | Type   | Description
| ------- | ------ | ------------
| priority | number | Priority for loading these objects. The lower the sooner they will be requested. Default: 0
| sort | boolean | When set to true, the function featureCallback will be called in some particular order (e.g. from orderApproxRouteLength).
| properties | bit array | Which properties of the features should be downloaded: OVERPASS_ID_ONLY, OVERPASS_BBOX, OVERPASS_TAGS, OVERPASS_GEOM, OVERPASS_META. Combine by binary OR: ``OVERPASS_ID | OVERPASS_BBOX``. Default: ``OVERPASS_BBOX | OVERPASS_TAGS | OVERPASS_MEMBERS``
| orderApproxRouteLength | boolean | Order objects by approximate route length (calculated from the diagonal of the bounding box)
| split | integer | If more than 'split' elements would be returned, split into several smaller requests, with 'split' elements each. Default: 0 (do not split)
| members | boolean | Query relation members of. Default: false
| memberCallback | function | For every member, call this callback function.
| memberProperties | bit array | Which properties should be loaded for the members.
| memberSplit | integer | If more than 'memberSplit' member elements would be returned, split into smaller requests (see 'split'). Default: 0 (do not split)

Returns an OverpassRequest object.

## OverpassFrontend.clearBBoxQuery(query)
Clears cached information about the given BBoxQuery. It won't remove the elements from cache though.

## OverpassFrontend.regexpEscape(str)
Escape a string for usage in a regular expression to the Overpass API.

Example:
```js
overpassFrontend.regexpEscape('bank+atm') // 'bank\+atm'
```

## OverpassFrontend.abortAllRequests()
Abort all currently running requests. For each request the final callback will be called with the error 'abort'. The currently running server request will be finished and the data loaded into the cache, but no feature callbacks will be called.

# OverpassObject: OverpassNode, OverpassWay, OverpassRelation
Passed to the featureCallback function.

## OverpassObject.intersects(bbox)
Returns:
* 2: if `bbox` intersects the object
* 1: `bbox` might intersect the object, e.g. when only the bounding box of the object is known.
* 0: `bbox` does not intersect the object (or the bounding box, it the exact geometry is not known)

## OverpassObject.leafletFeature(options)
Returns a feature for adding to a Leaflet based map. As options all Path resp. Marker options are available, additionally:

* nodeFeature: if the feature (or a relation member) is a node, create one of the following Layers: 'CircleMarker' (default), 'Circle', 'Marker'.
* radius: if nodeFeature is 'Circle' or 'CircleMarker', use this value as radius.

If the geometry is not available (e.g. it has not been loaded), will return `null`.

Example:
```js
function(err, ob) { // featureCallback function
  ob.leafletFeature({
    nodeFeature: 'CircleMarker',
    radius: 6,
    fillColor: 'red'
  }).addTo(map)
}
```

# OverpassRequest
An object describing a request to the Overpass API.
